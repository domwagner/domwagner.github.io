As corollaries, HoCHC shares desirable properties (such as semi-decidability and a canonical model property) and deciable fragments with its 1st-order counterpart.","tags":[],"title":"HoCHC: a Refutationally-complete and Semantically-invariant System of Higher-order Logic Modulo Theories","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"c6d12a24f7a657848f5eca2aed85a8b2","permalink":"https://domwagner.github.io/talk/hcvs/","publishdate":"2019-04-07T17:37:46-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/hcvs/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"HoCHC: a Refutationally-complete and Semantically-invariant System of Higher-order Logic Modulo Theories","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Master's Thesis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1531863466,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531863466,"objectID":"042488edfc1db719ac8cab8feb89dfa6","permalink":"https://domwagner.github.io/publication/msc/","publishdate":"2018-07-17T17:37:46-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/msc/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Resolution for Higher−Order Constrained Horn Clauses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bachelor's Thesis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1500327466,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1500327466,"objectID":"7839c3dbe565d010e77a2565f9abb60c","permalink":"https://domwagner.github.io/publication/bsc/","publishdate":"2017-07-17T17:37:46-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bsc/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Design and Implementation of a CDCL(LA) Calculus","type":"publication"}]

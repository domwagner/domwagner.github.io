This may compromise correctness of gradient-based optimisation methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We introduce a simple syntactic framework to define non-differentiable functions piecewisely and present a systematic approach to obtain smoothings for which the reparameterisation gradient estimator is unbiased. Our main contribution is a novel variant of SGD, Diagonalisation Stochastic Gradient Descent, which progressively enhances the accuracy of the smoothed approximation during optimisation, and we prove convergence to stationary points of the unsmoothed (original) objective. Our empirical evaluation reveals benefits over the state of the art: our approach is simple, fast, stable and attains orders of magnitude reduction in work-normalised variance.","tags":[],"title":"Diagonalisation SGD: Fast \u0026 Convergent SGD for Non-Differentiable Models via Reparameterisation and Smoothing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["DPhil (PhD) Thesis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1708205866,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1708205866,"objectID":"5495010a139177c7e3636016f3cd05b4","permalink":"https://domwagner.github.io/publication/dphil/","publishdate":"2024-02-17T17:37:46-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dphil/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Fast and Correct Variational Inference for Probabilistic Programming: Differentiability, Reparameterisation and Smoothing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Basim Khajwal","C.-H.

The dominant approach for optimisation in practice is stochastic gradient descent. In particular, a variant using the so-called reparameterisation gradient estimator exhibits fast convergence in a traditional statistics setting. Unfortunately, discontinuities, which are readily expressible in programming languages, can compromise the correctness of this approach. We consider a simple (higher-order, probabilistic) programming language with conditionals, and we endow our language with both a measurable and a smoothed (approximate) value semantics. We present type systems which establish technical pre-conditions. Thus we can prove stochastic gradient descent with the reparameterisation gradient estimator to be correct when applied to the smoothed problem. Besides, we can solve the original problem up to any error tolerance by choosing an accuracy coefficient suitably. Empirically we demonstrate that our approach has a similar convergence as a key competitor, but is simpler, faster, and attains orders of magnitude reduction in worknormalised variance","tags":[],"title":"Fast and Correct Gradient-Based Optimisation for Probabilistic Programming via Smoothing","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1673740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673740800,"objectID":"248621c4055459c913468253df06c23b","permalink":"https://domwagner.github.io/talk/lafi23/","publishdate":"2019-04-07T17:37:46-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/lafi23/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"On the Reparameterisation Gradient for Non-Differentiable but Continuous Models","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1643500800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643500800,"objectID":"983de129dc3f6f14005d2411e7930fa7","permalink":"https://domwagner.github.io/talk/logprob/","publishdate":"2019-04-07T17:37:46-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/logprob/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A Language and Smoothed Semantics for Convergent Stochastic Gradient Descent","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1642291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642291200,"objectID":"4f3b45175e2569e2cb3e670bedb7f375","permalink":"https://domwagner.github.io/talk/lafi/","publishdate":"2019-04-07T17:37:46-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/lafi/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A Language and Smoothed Semantics for Convergent Stochastic Gradient Descent","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1639353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639353600,"objectID":"6d16ecedb491caadde0ced44bffed00a","permalink":"https://domwagner.github.io/talk/diffprog/","publishdate":"2019-04-07T17:37:46-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/diffprog/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A Language and Smoothed Semantics for Convergent Stochastic Gradient Descent","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1617062400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617062400,"objectID":"13d0feeb8f8044965870dd4ab0bbd0b4","permalink":"https://domwagner.github.io/talk/esop/","publishdate":"2019-04-07T17:37:46-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/esop/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Densities of Almost Surely Terminating Probabilistic Programs are Differentiable Almost Everywhere","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Carol Mak","C.-H.
